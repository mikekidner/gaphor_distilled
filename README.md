# Gaphor_Distilled

## SYSML Distilled
[SysML Distilled](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/SysML_Distilled/3bMJAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PR7&printsec=frontcover) diagrams implemented in [Gaphor](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor)

This repo is intended to show how the model from the well known refererence "[SYSML Distilled](https://delligattiassociates.com/publications/?_gl=1*1tu6ekh*_ga*MTMwMTU4NjMyNC4xNzMyNTYyOTUw*_up*MQ..)" can be implemented in the simple modelling tool "[Gaphor](gaphor.org)". This hopefully provides another useful reference for Gaphor users.

## UML Distilled
[UML Distilled](https://martinfowler.com/books/uml.html) is the go to reference for UML. This repo also includes a gaphor 
model for the diagrams in this book. UML Distilled doesn't have a single overarching model, so this model is a bit less 
tidy.  


## Contributing
Currently the models are far from complete and so plenty of help is required to implement sections.

If you find diagrams that cannot be implemented in Gaphor, please raise an issue on the [Gaphor Github](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor), and even try to contribute a solution.

See the diagram index diagram for which diagrams exist.
