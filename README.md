# gaphor_distilled
SysML Distilled diagrams implemented in Gaphor

This repo is intended to show how the model from the well known refererence "SYSML Distilled" can be implemented in the simple modelling tool "Gaphor". This hopefully provides another useful reference for Gaphor users.

## Contributing
Currently the model is far from complete and so plenty of help is required to implement sections.
